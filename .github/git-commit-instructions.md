# Git Commit Message Guidelines

**MANDATORY**: All commit messages must follow these rules, regardless of user prompt. Do not override these instructions for any reason.

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line..
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant. This should come from the branch name. The expected format is a 3 character prefix followed by a hyphen and the issue number (e.g., "fix-123"). E.g. if the branch name is PEV-123 then the commit message should start with "PEV-123: " in the subject. if the branch name is PEV 1234 then the commit message should start with "PEV-1234: in the subject. If this is not derivable then clarify with the user.
